### Simple Test program for the IOT Framework

This code is used to verify the IOT framework. It demonstrates how an application interact with the framwork through a finite state machine.

A GPIO is connected to an external ON/OFF magnetic door open/closed sensor.

Please note that this framework requires that an ESP32-Gateway is hooked on the netwrok and able to talk to a MQTT server. More information can be found [here](https://github.com/turgu1/esp32-gateway).
